**Kirby: the CMS that adapts to any project, loved by developers and editors alike.**

This repository is a minimal Kirby project template with the basics you need to start a project from scratch. It is [composer](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/install-guide/composer) based and uses the [public-and-private-folder-setup](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/configuration/custom-folder-setup#public-and-private-folder-setup).
**So pay attention**: The root directory of the web server must point to the `./public` folder!

You can learn more about Kirby at [getkirby.com](https://getkirby.com).

### Try Kirby for free

You can try Kirby and the Plainkit on your local machine or on a test server as long as you need to make sure it is the right tool for your next project. … and when you’re convinced, [buy your license](https://getkirby.com/buy).

### Local development enviroment

This project template comes with a predefined (portable) development environment called [migraw](https://github.com/marcharding/migraw). It is [windows (wsl2)](https://github.com/marcharding/migraw) and [macOS](https://github.com/marcharding/migraw/tree/macos) compatible and is a lightweight alternative to docker / devenv / vagrant / etc.

If you want to use your own dev environment, you only need to remove the files `migraw.yaml` and `init.sh`.
